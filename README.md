# HYGIENIC FOOD DISTRIBUTION DATABASE
## 1. **Problem statement:**
Getting hygienic food these days is becoming difficult and to achieve this, requires more effort,time, and patience. So here the business's main goal is to prepare hygienic food and supply it to the customers by setting up kitchens and staff across the city, state, and even country. Analyzing the business insights and taking the necessary actions towards the improvement of the business goals, requires collecting the daily business data and store it in a database, which later on can be accessed using SQL queries.

Below are the goals of the business:
1. To make profits from sales by focusing on the most ordered or sold food item, we use the monthly or quarterly sales report. This should be provided for each store so that the manager of a particular store can take the necessary steps accordingly.
2. Report on the drop or rise in the number of customers region-wise, so that this would help
in changing the staff training plans. Also, it will be utilized to increase or decrease or
distribution of the manpower to different regions.
3. With the help of the previous year’s sales trends, offering monthly packages and discounts
at the peak times of the year to grab more customers. For example, during the educational
institutions re-open.
4. Report on the frequency of the orders made during a particular time (morning, noon, or
evening) and schedule the manpower accordingly.
5. The food items on the menu are placed in the order for each location based on the number
of orders made for that item.
6. There would be days when fewer sales are observed (Summer break for educational
institutes). During this period, we introduce different food items like desserts, ice creams,
and cool drinks which would compensate for the total sales made.
7. Discounts are to be given to the customers who have ordered regularly based on the
previous year’s sales report, and their contribution towards the business profits.
8. At each location, the Manager would schedule the manforce shifts based on the busy days
in the week.
9. Decrease or Increase in the purchase of raw materials based on the previous month's sales.
10. The manager should be able to fire, hire, or train chefs based on the feedback from the
customers.
11. With the previous few year’s profits and sales reports, the regional head should be able to
figure out the locations where a new kitchen setup is to be established so that they could
grab more customers' attention and serve them.

### 2. **EER diagrams:**
ER models are basically called entity relational models which illustrate how the entities are related to each other with a set of relations, whereas EER models are extended relational models which are used for complex entities. We have done the EER diagram for the hygienic food distribution database which consist of 8 entities that are
* Employee
* Customer
* Kitchen
* Order
* Discount
* Menu
* Raw materials
* Region

You can navigate to the EER diagram [here](https://github.com/saisanthosh1982/Hygienic-Food-Distribution-Database/blob/main/Phase-2/EER%20Diagram.pdf) 

### 3. **Relational Mapping and Functional dependencies:**
We convert the ERR diagram to relational mapping with the help of the min max where we pull the entities from one to the other and do the relational mapping between them. We do the following steps in mapping they are:
* Identifying both primary keys and foreign keys among all the relations, which can be
seen in terms of arrows from one entity to the other entity.
* Identify the functional dependencies for all the relations and show them in a table
* Identify all the candidate keys in the relations

### 4. **Creating Database and Building various Querys:**
We have created all the tables that are required according to the relational mapping and converted them into tables and have enterred dummpy data into all the tables which helps us to retrieve the results.
Database practices involve 
* Creating tables
* Inserting the data into the tables
* Retrieve data from tables
* Update the tables and see the change in results using query
* Dropping all the tables and creating them back for any redundant tables

You can get access to all the tables [here](https://github.com/saisanthosh1982/Hygienic-Food-Distribution-Database/tree/main/Phase-4)
### Key takeaways:
It was a great opportunity for us to work with different personalities and learn from others to improve our skills mainly working with real-time data has given us more exposure to the database which will help us to upskill toward the database systems, finally, we want to thank you for all the process and the phases in the project through which we have learned a lot from each other
